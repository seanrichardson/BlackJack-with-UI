Just finished everything so it will not let a player set
a bet or keep playing if they are out of money. It basically
skips their turn.

Next thing I need to do is set up an out of money text
box that replaces "Bet: 0 and Total Money: 0".

It would also be nice to make it so it does not let players
bet more money then they currently have.
